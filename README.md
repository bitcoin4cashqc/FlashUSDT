🔍 Overview

This project provides a Python-based utility for generating controlled pending transactions on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains. By broadcasting transactions with intentionally constrained gas settings, researchers can analyze:

How long different wallets keep a transaction displayed

Whether wallets differentiate between valid vs. stale mempool transactions

How notifications behave when a transaction is rebroadcast

UX or security issues that may confuse non-technical users

Some wallets (e.g., Exodus) may show persistent or repeating notifications for pending transactions, which can mislead users into thinking a transfer is occurring when it is merely stuck in the mempool.
